# Turtle-Neuroevolution
#### Investigating simple adaptive agent cognition through neuro-evolution and competitive environments.

### Summary
A NetLogo agent-based model of competitive neuroevolution. "Turtle" agents compete for food so they can reproduce, and their offspring have a change to mutate their neural network brains randomly.

### Running
Using the given 'venv' virtual envrionment folder, install the newest versions of PyTorch and NumPy. The given 'network.py' file is the basis for each agents brain, and containts the necessary mutation and action functions. [This line](TurtleEvoSim.nlogo#L15) should point to the Python path in the virutal environment.
